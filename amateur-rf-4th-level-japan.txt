Engineering
===========

Transmission
------------

VOX (SSB Tx): Voice Operated Transmission
    - If no voice being transmitted, stop the tx from consuming power

ALC (SSB Tx): Automatic Level Control
    - Attenuates hizumi before entering the Power amplifer 

Speech clipper (SSB Tx): clips the amplified voice, before the modulator.

IDC (FM Tx): Instantaneous Deviation Control
    - Limits the maximum deviation of the FM transmitter (like the speech clipper)

AFC (FM Tx): Automatic Frequency Control
    - used to stabilize the freq of the oscillator when using a LC instead of
      a crystal.

Reception
---------

IFT (DSB Rx): Intermediate Frequency Transformer
    - LC band pass filter that comes with the IF amplifier of the DSB 
      superheterodine (2-phases) receiver.
    - Can be improved by adding a BPF (band pass filter) made of crystal.

AGC (DSB Rx): Automatic Gain Control (for PHASING!)
    - On the DSB receiver depending on the power of the received signal
      the sound volume will vary
    - AGC is used to automatically control the gain of the IF amplifier
      so that the sound volume is always the same.

Amplitude limiter (FM Rx): limits the amplitud of the received wave. It goes
                           after the intermediate amplifier.

Skelch circuit (FM Rx): remove speaker buzz if no signal received

BFO (CW/A1A=Morse): Beat Frequency Oscillator
    - Morse (on or off) --> BFO --> detector --> speaker
    - Used to receive morse

RIT or clarifier (SSB Rx): Receiving Incremental Tuning
    - used to clarify 明りょう度 the sound heard in the speaker
    - it tunes the frequency of the local oscillator of the mixer 
      周波数変換部の局部発信器の発信周波数
    - it has a knob <tsumami>

Common
------

ANL: automatic noise limiter
S meter: displays the strength of the received signal 
    - Typically AGC voltage or Detector's current

       正確に行うものとし <seikaku>, fix 訂正 <teisei> it immediately 
       直ちに <tadachi-ni>!

Before starting a call to a radio station 相手局

    - listen carefully 聴守 to the frequencies that you are going to use
    - make sure there are no other communications you could interfere with
        + except in extraordinary cases <hijou-no-baai>

Procedure for calling to a radio station
    - 呼出事項
        1) 3 times以下: his radio station call sign 相手局の呼出符号
            + if calling the aitekata radio stations in your certificate
                -> 3 times exactly
                -> instead of their call signs, you can use 'CQ' + 相手局
                   [Note] if you only use CQ then it's like a general call
        2) 1 time: こちらは
        3) 3 times以下: my radio station call sign 自局の呼出符号
        4) 1 time: どうぞ
            + only if you are calling the aitekata stations in your certificate
    - Exceptions
        + If 50Watt以下 and I know he will receive my signal, only 1) is fine.
    - If nobody answers: wait at least 3 minutes
    - If you are told to be interfering: quickly <tadachi ni> stop calling

Procedure for answering 応答 <outou>

    - If you are sure you were called, but couldn't understand by who?
        + answer, and in 1) instead of his 呼出符号 (which you don't know) 
          say 誰かこちらを呼びましたか
